    <string name="welcome_1">1. The word \"Mission\":  You will see the word \"Mission\" very often on Balloon. And the best way to understand it is to see it as the word \"Errand\" or \"Task\" or \"Job\". When we say \"Create a Mission\", we are simply saying \"Create an Errand\" or \"Create a Task\". So \"Create a Mission\" simply means \"Create a Task\" you want your Evangelists to do for you.</string>
    <string name="welcome_2">2. The word \"Evangelists\":  You will also see the word \"Evangelists\" very often on Balloon. And even though it sounds religious, it doesn\'t mean that. When we say \"Evangelists\", we are talking about normal day to day people. They are not religious people or anything like that. They are normal everyday people. But we call them \"Evangelists\" because they are as passionate about promoting your music the same way religious Evangelists are passionate about promoting God or Allah. So when you see \"Evangelists\" on Balloon. It doesn\'t mean religious people. It simply means people that are willing to passionately promote your music on the internet - for any amount that you decide to give them.</string>
