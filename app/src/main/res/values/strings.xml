    <string name="welcome_1"><b>1. The word Mission:</b>  You will see the word Mission very often on Balloon. And the best way to understand it is to see it as the word Errand or Task or Job. When we say Create a Mission, we are simply saying Create an Errand or Create a Task. So Create a Mission simply means Create a Task you want your Evangelists to do for you.</string>
    <string name="welcome_2"><b>2. The word Evangelists:</b>  You will also see the word Evangelists very often on Balloon. And even though it sounds religious, it doesnt mean that. When we say Evangelists, we are talking about normal day to day people. They are not religious people or anything like that. They are normal everyday people. But we call them Evangelists because they are as passionate about promoting your music the same way religious Evangelists are passionate about promoting God or Allah. So when you see Evangelists on Balloon. It doesnt mean religious people. It simply means people that are willing to passionately promote your music on the internet - for any amount that you decide to give them.</string>
